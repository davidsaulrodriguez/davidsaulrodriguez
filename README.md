# :wave: Hi, I'm  David Rodriguez
### I'm A Software Engineer and Full Stack Developer :man_technologist:

I am a self-taught software engineer and a Graduate from the [UCONN School of Engineering][usoe]'s [Coding Boot Camp][ucbc] (in partnership with [Triliogy Education Services](TrilogyED)) and a _Certified Full Stack Web Developer_.

I have a passion for learning and I'm always looking to improve my skills. I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow.

I am currently employed at [Ingram Micro](https://ingrammicro.com) as a Software Engineer and working in the UI/UX department for a project called [Communication Solution Services](https://netxusa.com/) (formally codenamed: Maverick).

I am passionate about making open-source software as well as creating software and projects that are completely free and open. My license of choice is the [BSD-2-Clause][bsdLicense] license because I don't believe in placing restrictions of use on the software I create and release.

>"Free software is a matter of liberty, not price. To understand the concept, you should think of free as in free speech, not as in free beer."
>
> â€” Richard Stallman
