# :wave: Hi, I'm  David Rodriguez :man_technologist:
### I'm A Full Stack Developer

I am a self-taught software engineer and more recently a student participating in the [UCONN School of Engineering][usoe]'s [Coding Boot Camp][ucbc] (in partnership with [Triliogy Education Services](TrilogyED)) to become a _Certified_ Full stack Web Developer.

I am passionate about making open-source software and creating software and projects that are completely free and open. My license of choice is the [BSD-2-Clause][bsdLicense] license because I don't believe in placing restrictions of use on the software I create and release.

>Free software is a matter of liberty, not price. To understand the concept, you should think of free as in free speech, not as in free beer.
>
> â€” Richard Stallman
