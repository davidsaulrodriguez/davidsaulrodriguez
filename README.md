# :wave: Hi, I'm  David Rodriguez

### I'm A Software Engineer and Full Stack Developer :man_technologist:

I am mainly a self-taught software engineer and a graduate from the [UCONN School of Engineering][usoe]'
s [Coding Boot Camp][ucbc] (in partnership with ~~Triliogy Education Services~~ [edX][edX]) and a _Certified Full Stack
Web Developer_ (Personally, it was a waste of $12,000 if I'm being honest).

I have a passion for learning and I'm always looking to improve my skills. I'm always looking for new challenges and
opportunities to learn and grow.

I am currently employed at [EverConvert][EverConvert] as a **Full Stack [Laravel][Laravel] Developer**.

I am passionate about making open-source software as well as creating software and projects that are completely free and
open. My license of choice is the [BSD-2-Clause][bsdLicense] license because I don't believe in placing restrictions of
use on the software I create and release.
